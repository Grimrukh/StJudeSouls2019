--- NOTES ---

CHARACTER CREATION
	- Have to handle weapons somehow.
	- Maybe just give most of them to Andre for sale, for varying amounts.
	- Titanite is very precious, and can't be bought?

- Player begins in Undead Asylum.
- You're thrown the keys by Oscar, just like before.
- You can free your allies from the three other cells:
	- Solaire!
	- Siegmeyer!
	- Patches!
	- The front door of the church won't open until you free them.
- Manus appears, and after a short fight, the other Primordial Serpents
appear in the arena. 
	- Dark portals (Manus portal effect) appear where your allies are,
	and they disappear.
	- Manus then kills you.
- You wake up in New Londo Ruins, outside the house.
	- Almost all of the ghosts are gone...
	- So are the treasure corpses, except maybe a couple with specific items.
	- No Ingward.

- Note that you never receive the Estus Flask.
- Only "humanity" can heal you (new name). It doesn't give you actual soft humanity.
- Instead, your soft humanity counts the number of allies rescued during the game.
	
QUEST 0: Sif in New Londo Ruins
	- Sif is trapped by ghosts in the house in New Londo (in yellow ring).
	- The only way to save her is by killing the ghosts.
	- But you can't do that without becoming cursed, or a Transient Curse,
	which is not available here.
	- You can travel directly to Firelink Shrine.
	
	? Where do you get cursed? I think having a Basilisk hidden somewhere in one
	level, and a Transient Curse item hidden in another, is the way to go. Both
	in the first three levels.
	
FIRELINK SHRINE
	- Ring of St Jude can be found on a corpse near the shrine.
		- The description talks about a promise to protect those who need it.
	- You finally receive your Estus Flask here. It also has a new description.
	- There are paths to Burg (stairs), Catacombs (graveyard stairs), and Sen's (cliff lift).
	- Frampt can be heard snoring after one ally has been rescued.
	- Anor Londo, Archives, and Blighttown become available after Frampt awakens.
	- There are interactable things in the graveyard, in the nest up top, etc.
	- You warp to the level when you move towards it.
		- Anor Londo is accessed from the Crow's nest. The crow picks you up (you need an item
		from Frampt to get it to appear) and then you appear on the Anor Londo balcony (before
		the fog into the interior). The Crow sits on the edge here and will take you back if
		you speak to it (invincible).
		- Archives is accessed the same way, via the crow, but you need to have a particular
		ring equipped while you curl up in the nest.
		- (How does your ally travel via Crow? Whatever.)
	- When you rescue an ally, they will move to Firelink Shrine.
		- They are on 'white phantom' team and cannot be attacked (and there are no enemies around).
		- Make sure any skeletons in the graveyard (if there are any) don't go far enough to them.
		- They gather quite close to the bonfire, unlike standard DS.
		- Sif teleports there when you rescue him below.
	- You can't talk to them, but interacting with them will select the ally who will join you
	on missions.
	- A status message tells you that you can select your ally by speaking with them, after you
	rescue your second one.
	- When an ally dies in a level, they will respawn along with you when you die.
	- Andre moves to... somewhere easily accessible.
	
QUEST 1: Solaire in Undead Burg
	- Solaire is held prisoner in the Parish cell.
	- You start at the end of the aqueduct, before Lower Burg.
	- (No suggestions for this one so far, so it's all on me.)
	- I'm thinking a series of smaller "puzzles" to get there.
	- Ends with a Gargoyle boss fight of some kind. Need to think of something new for it.
	- When Solaire is freed, he stands up and bows, and you're warped back to Firelink.
	- Gates: 
		- No access to the abandoned church where Andre normally is.
		- No access to the back of Lower Undead Burg?
		- Walking down the stairs into the aqueduct at the start of Burg will warp you?
		
	- Problem: I want to use the Firelink parish elevator as the transition to Sen's
	Fortress. That means it's weird to use the Parish for Solaire.
	- Solution: Solaire is trapped at the Sunlight Altar, by the Dragon. The puzzle
	is how to get past it. That's where the level ends (when you pull the lever inside).

QUEST 2: Siegmeyer in Sen's Fortress.
	- Siegmeyer is in the torture cage where Logan was.
	- The gist of the puzzle is finding a way to break the wall to get there, and
	finding the key to unlock his cage.
	- The boulders come hard and fast, but with breaks.
	- Again, no suggestions here (using the Mimic thing for Archives).
	- Puzzle involves boulders, and working the boulder mechanism.
	- Transient Curse hidden somewhere.
	- Gates:
		- No access to outside?
		- Fortress gate is shut, with you inside.
	- Hang on - feels silly getting here via the Parish elevator when Solaire's level
	uses that area directly...
	
QUEST 3: Patches in the Catacombs.
	- Patches is a bit different; he tricks you somehow.
	- Not sure how him tricking you will work when dying sends you back to the start
	of the level.
	- Solution: two starts, one before he tricks you and one after.
	- I'm thinking something about
