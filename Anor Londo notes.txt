ANOR LONDO CLUES

- Griggs' letter. Gives you the basic quest.

- Letter carried by a Painting Guardian in the dark basement:
Note found on a cloaked servant:

"Ester,
We must act soon; I believe he is
beginning to suspect something. Bring
the beast to my bedroom and hide the
cage under my bed. I will take care
of the rest.
                Your True King"
                
- Inspect under Scornstein's bed:
"An empty cage lies beneath the bed.\nTraces of fur remain inside."

- Under Mornstein's bed: 
"There is nothing under the bed."

- Inspect the blue dragon head:
"The symbol \"M.\" is carved into the scales."

- Inspect the lower left fireplace:
(Get Charred Scrap) 2009
Burned scrap of paper among
the ashes:

"-but he's been envious of me ever
since I took down that blue beast
after he missed his shot. He has
to die. Leonia will be better off
without such weakness..."

- Other fireplaces:
"Nothing but ashes."

- Inspect Blacksmith's stuff (324):
(Get Message to the Paintsmith) 323
Note found on an anvil:

"Beautiful work, but the figure is
a little... fuller than I was
expecting. Can you tone it down a
notch? I want our guests looking 
at the other paintings as well!
                --S."

- Etched Message (324):
"Use this to carefully burn the 
edges of the paper. Make it look 
natural.

Then destroy this stone before
the demon I stole it from comes
looking for it..."

- Found on corpse on roof (325):
Royal commendation:
"My loyal attendant,
Thank you for rescuing that artwork 
for me. I certainly do not share my 
brother's qualms with it, and he 
is welcome to whatever diminished
version the smith is working on for
him.

Please hang it in my bedroom at once."
